Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: How to handle RTSP streams in Raycast UI? What are the best practices and technical approaches for displaying RTSP video streams in an Electron/web-based UI like Raycast?
To handle RTSP streams in a Raycast-like UI using Electron/web technologies, there are a few key approaches:

1. Use a proxy server to convert RTSP to a web-compatible format:
- Set up a server (e.g. Node.js) to receive the RTSP stream
- Use ffmpeg to transcode the RTSP stream to HLS or WebRTC
- Serve the converted stream to the Electron app over WebSocket or HTTP[1][3]

2. Leverage WebRTC for low-latency streaming:
- Use RTSPtoWebRTC proxy to convert RTSP to WebRTC
- Implement a WebRTC player in the Electron app using JavaScript APIs[1]

3. For Electron specifically:
- Use node-rtsp-stream package to handle RTSP streams
- Render video frames to a canvas element in the UI[2]

Example Node.js proxy server code:

```javascript
const Stream = require('node-rtsp-stream')

const stream = new Stream({
  name: 'name',
  streamUrl: 'rtsp://192.168.0.1/stream',
  wsPort: 9999
})

// In Electron app
const canvas = document.getElementById('videoCanvas')
const client = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9999/')

client.onmessage = (message) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(message.data)
  if (data.type === 'video') {
    // Render video frame to canvas
  }
}
```

Key considerations:
- Use TCP for RTSP transport if UDP is blocked[4]
- Adjust buffer size to balance latency and smoothness[8]
- For multiple streams, use layouts like grid view[8]
- Set appropriate I-frame and FPS rates on cameras[8]

The most robust approach is using a proxy server to handle protocol conversion, allowing the Electron app to use standard web video playback.
