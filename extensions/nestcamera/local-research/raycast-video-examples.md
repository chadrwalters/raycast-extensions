Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: How to render video in Raycast extensions? Are there any existing Raycast extensions that handle video streaming or camera feeds? Search for examples on GitHub.
Raycast extensions do not natively support rendering video or camera feeds. The Raycast API is primarily focused on text-based interfaces and static images. There are no built-in components for video playback or streaming.

Some workarounds developers have used:

1. Linking to external video players:
```javascript
import { open } from "@raycast/api";

export default async function Command() {
  await open("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ");
}
```

2. Displaying static thumbnails or preview images:
```javascript
import { Detail } from "@raycast/api";

export default function Command() {
  return (
    <Detail
      markdown={`![Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/0.jpg)`}
    />
  );
}
```

3. Using animated GIFs as a limited form of "video":
```javascript
import { Detail } from "@raycast/api";

export default function Command() {
  return (
    <Detail
      markdown={`![Animated GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/Ju7l5y9osyymQ/giphy.gif)`}
    />
  );
}
```

There are no examples on GitHub of Raycast extensions directly handling video streams or camera feeds. The closest are extensions that interact with video services like YouTube, but these typically just provide search and metadata, not actual video playback[1][6].
