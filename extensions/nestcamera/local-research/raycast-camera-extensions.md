Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: Are there any Raycast extensions for security cameras, surveillance systems, or IP cameras? How do they handle video feeds? Search GitHub and Raycast store.
Based on the search results, there don't appear to be any specific Raycast extensions for security cameras, surveillance systems, or IP cameras. The Raycast store and GitHub repositories don't show any extensions directly related to these topics.

However, Raycast does have a general "Open Camera" command that allows users to preview their computer's camera feed[5]. This is mainly intended for checking webcams before meetings rather than for security purposes.

For handling video feeds, Raycast extensions can potentially integrate with APIs and display video content, but there are no ready-made extensions for security camera feeds. Developers could potentially create custom extensions to interface with IP camera systems, but this would require custom development.

The closest related extension found is "PurpleAir", which reads air quality data from sensors[4], but this doesn't involve video feeds.

If someone wanted to create a security camera extension, they would need to use the Raycast API to develop a custom extension that interfaces with their specific camera system's API or software.
