# Nest Camera Raycast Extension PRD

## Overview
A Raycast extension that provides quick access to Google Nest camera feeds through RTSP streaming with FFmpeg and HLS, enabling users to view their camera feeds with minimal interaction. This extension is specifically designed for the Nest Cam Indoor (1st gen) model, which only supports RTSP streaming.

## Problem Statement
Users want quick access to their Nest camera feeds without opening the Google Home app or website. Current solutions require multiple clicks and app switches, making it inefficient for quick camera checks. The Nest Cam Indoor (1st gen) only supports RTSP streaming, requiring a specialized solution for reliable playback.

## Goals
- Provide instant access to Nest camera feeds through RTSP streaming with FFmpeg transcoding to HLS
- Support authentication with Google Nest/Home using OAuth2 with PKCE
- Enable quick camera switching with intuitive search and filtering
- Support hotkey access to favorite cameras
- Provide reliable stream playback through Safari's native HLS support
- Provide clear error feedback and recovery options

## Non-Goals
- Camera configuration/settings management
- Recording/snapshot capabilities
- Multi-camera simultaneous viewing
- Custom video player UI
- Embedded video playback within Raycast
- Cross-platform support (macOS-only)
- WebRTC streaming support (due to technical limitations)

## User Experience

### Authentication Flow
1. First-time setup:
   - OAuth2 authentication with Google using PKCE
   - Secure token storage using Raycast's SecureStorage
   - Automatic token refresh handling
   - Clear error messaging for auth issues

### Camera Selection
1. Main Interface:
   - List available cameras with room/location grouping
   - Search/filter capabilities
   - Online/offline status indicators
   - Quick access to favorite cameras
   - Last used camera memory

2. Camera Actions:
   - Open in Safari with HLS stream
   - Launch with Picture-in-Picture mode
   - Set as favorite for hotkey access
   - Remember window positions

### Stream Viewing
1. Launch Options:
   - Standard Safari window with HLS stream
   - Picture-in-Picture mode
   - Full-screen capability
   - Position memory per camera

2. Error Handling:
   - Clear error messages with recovery steps
   - Automatic retry for recoverable errors
   - Manual fallback instructions when needed
   - Network status monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication
- OAuth2 with PKCE implementation
- Secure token storage using Raycast's SecureStorage
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Error recovery for auth failures

### API Integration
- Google Smart Device Management (SDM) API
- RTSP stream URL generation
- FFmpeg transcoding to HLS
- Safari HLS playback integration
- Window position management

### Performance
- Stream initialization < 5 seconds
- Camera list retrieval < 1 second
- Reliable stream playback
- Efficient resource management

## Success Metrics
1. Time to view (from hotkey to visible stream)
   - Target: < 5 seconds
   - Fallback handling < 7 seconds
2. Authentication reliability
   - Token refresh success rate > 99%
   - Clear error recovery paths
3. Stream stability
   - Successful stream start rate > 95%
   - Recovery from network issues < 3 seconds
4. User interaction time
   - Camera selection to stream < 2 clicks
   - PiP mode activation < 1 click

## Questions & Dependencies

### Dependencies
1. Google Device Access registration ($5 fee)
2. OAuth client setup
3. FFmpeg installation
4. Safari (for HLS playback)
5. macOS permissions for:
   - Process execution
   - Network access
   - Browser automation

### Technical Constraints
1. Camera Model Support
   - Specifically designed for Nest Cam Indoor (1st gen)
   - Only supports RTSP streaming protocol
   - No support for newer streaming protocols (WebRTC)
2. RTSP stream availability
3. FFmpeg transcoding performance
4. Raycast extension limitations:
   - No embedded video playback
   - No custom UI components
   - Limited to provided APIs
