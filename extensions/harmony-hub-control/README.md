## Troubleshooting

### Hub Discovery Issues

If your hub isn't found automatically:
1. Verify the hub is powered on and connected to your network
2. Check that your Mac and hub are on the same network
3. Ensure ports 35000-35004 are not blocked by your firewall
4. Try restarting your Harmony Hub

### Connection Problems

If you experience connection issues:
1. Check your network connectivity
2. Verify the hub's IP hasn't changed
3. Try clearing the extension's cache
4. Restart the extension

### Command Execution Failures

If commands aren't working:
1. Ensure the target device is powered on
2. Check if the hub has line of sight to the device
3. Verify the command is supported by your device
4. Try restarting the current activity

## Technical Details
